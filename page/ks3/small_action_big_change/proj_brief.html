          <p>Hi Team,</p>
  
          <p>This year, we’re kicking off something exciting—and you’re leading the charge.</p>
  
          <p>At <strong>Codefez Media</strong>, we believe that small steps can lead to big change. Our new campaign, <strong>“Small Action, Big Change”</strong>, is all about inspiring people to make meaningful choices in their everyday lives. From using reusable bags to simply checking in on a friend, every action counts.</p>
  
          <p>We need your creative minds to bring this campaign to life. You’ll be acting as our internal creative agency, tasked with crafting a full promotional package that motivates, informs, and inspires.</p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-2">Your Mission</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
            <li><strong>The Big Idea</strong> – Come up with a campaign concept that captures hearts and gets people talking.</li>
            <li><strong>Logo Design</strong> – Design a bold, memorable logo that defines the campaign's visual identity.</li>
            <li><strong>Research & Insight</strong> – Find statistics, case studies, or stories that show the real-world impact of small actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Poster Design</strong> – Create a compelling and professional poster suitable for public spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Podcast Segment</strong> – Script and record a short, punchy podcast ad to help broadcast the campaign's message.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>Let’s be honest: last year’s campaign, <em>“Don’t Be a Couch Potato, Be a Sweet Potato”</em>, didn’t exactly go viral. The messaging was a little... undercooked, and the visuals left people more confused than inspired. This year, we’re aiming for clarity, creativity, and genuine connection with our audience.</p>

        <div class="card bg-white shadow-md p-6">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-secondary mb-2">Final Deliverable</h2>
